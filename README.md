## Set Up
### The web application solution
First clone this repository to anywhere are you computer. Once you have done this, move on to the instructions for Nginx.

### Nginx
> NGINX is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. NGINX is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption. - https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/

+ First go to http://nginx.org/en/download.html and download the latest stable version of Nginx.
+ Once you have unzipped Nginx, go to the conf folder, and edit nginx.conf to look like the following:
```
worker_processes  1;
events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}
http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;
    sendfile        on;
    keepalive_timeout  65;
    upstream dev-wotif  {
        server localhost:9000;
    }
    server {
        listen   8090;
        root "C:\HomeFolders\david.kroukamp\My Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\WotIf.WebApp\wotif-webapp\src";
        index index.html;
        server_name localhost;
        location / {
            try_files $uri /index.html;
        }
        location /api {
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_pass http://dev-wotif;
        }
    }
}
```
+ Make sure that the root element in nginx.conf is pointing to your own local copy of the web application src folder, and not mine!
+ Open a terminal in the Nginx folder, and type "start nginx". (Make sure that nginx is then running in your task manager, if not, then something is broken).
Once you have Nginx working, move on to the instructions for NodeJS and Webpack.

### NodeJS and Webpack
>Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world. - https://nodejs.org/en/

> Webpack is a module bundler.
> Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. - http://webpack.github.io/docs/what-is-webpack.html

+ Go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download the current version of Node (not the one that is recommended for most users).
+ Once you have installed Node, make sure that it has been added to your path by opening a new terminal and typing "node -v". This will tell you your version of Node.
+ Also make sure that npm is now added to the path by typing "npm -v" to see your version of npm.
+ Now open a terminal in the root of your copy of the WotIf? web applcation (not in the src folder) and type "npm install". This will use the node package manager to resolve all the dependencies for the web application.
+ Now type "npm install -g webpack" to allow you to use webpack commands in your terminal.
+ Type "webpack" to use webpack to build your web application.
+ Every time you make a change to any of the website code, you will have to run "webpack" again to build the changes, and then refresh your page in the browser.

### Running the website
If you have followed the above steps, you should now be able to run the website by going to "localhost:8090" (unless I have forgotten a step somewhere). Make sure that you have your WebAPI solution running in Visual Studio so that your website has something to communicate with.
